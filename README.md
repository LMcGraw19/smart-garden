# Important Notes
- Keep everything clean and organized please, try not to add too many files and always be sure to add the changes you made within the commit.
- If in future there are any major changes to the code or a change in direction for the project, be sure to create a new branch so that we may experiment before merging it with the master branch.

Be sure to watch/read the instructions for using Git and Github, if you're unsure about pushing your commit don't be afraid to get in touch with me. I'll gladly help :))
