# smart-garden
Repository for the Smart Garden Group Project

# Important Notes
- Keep everything clean and organized please, try not to add too many files and always be sure to add a comment to the changes you made within the commit.
- If in future there are any major changes to the code or a change in direction for the project, be sure to create a new branch so that we may experiment before merging it with the master branch.
- New Branches must have a clear name.
- Main branch is NOT the default for this Repo despite the name, it may be viewed as an optional alternative starting point for either the website/database. It's currently giving me some synching issues, so I would recommend for you to make your own Branches until this is resolved. 

Be sure to watch/read the instructions for using Git and Github, if you're unsure about pushing your commit don't be afraid to get in touch with me. I'll gladly help :))
